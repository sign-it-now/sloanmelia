=== MODULE 6: FINANCIAL AID HUB ===

Three tabs: FAFSA Guide | 529 Tracker | Scholarships

--- TAB: FAFSA GUIDE ---

Accordion sections (click to expand):

What to gather: prior year tax returns for parents and student, W-2 forms, bank account balances, investment account balances, Social Security numbers for student and parents, FSA ID (create at studentaid.gov), Sloan's driver's license if she has one.

Section 2: KEY FAFSA FACTS
- Opens October 1 each year for the following academic year
- Illinois priority deadline: typically late January — check isac.org each year
- Student Aid Index (SAI) replaces Expected Family Contribution (EFC) starting 2024-2025
- Lower SAI = more aid eligible
- Most schools use FAFSA for ALL financial aid including scholarships

Section 3: WHAT COUNTS AS ASSETS
- Parent assets counted at max 5.64% toward SAI (low impact)
- Student assets counted at 20% toward SAI (higher impact)
- Parent-owned 529 plan: only 5.64% counts toward SAI — very favorable
- Primary home equity: does NOT count on FAFSA
- Retirement accounts: do NOT count on FAFSA

Section 4: ILLINOIS-SPECIFIC AID
- MAP Grant (Monetary Award Program): up to $5,968/year for IL residents with financial need — requires FAFSA by state deadline
- Check isac.org for current year deadlines and amounts

Section 5: AFTER YOU SUBMIT
- Schools receive your SAI and build aid packages
- You receive award letters — compare them carefully
- Award letters may mix grants (free), loans (repay), and work-study
- Net price = total cost minus grants only (not loans)

Each section has: "Ask Coach" button that opens Coach chat with that FAFSA topic pre-loaded.

• Federal taxes: contributions NOT deductible; earnings grow tax-FREE; qualified withdrawals 100% tax-free
• FAFSA impact: parent-owned 529 counts as only 5.64% toward SAI — minimal impact on aid
• SECURE 2.0 (2024): unused funds can roll to Roth IRA — up to $35,000 lifetime, account must be 15+ years old
• Link: brightstartsavings.com

=== MODULE 7: THE COACH (STAR FEATURE) ===

The Coach is powered by a Supabase Edge Function that calls the Anthropic Claude API.

Edge Function URL: stored in environment variable VITE_COACH_URL
(User will create this Edge Function separately — show a setup notice if the URL is not configured)

Three tabs inside the Coach module:

--- COACH TAB 1: CHAT ---

Chat interface:
- Message history displayed as bubbles (user = right side gold, coach = left side white with dark border)
- Input bar at bottom with send button (enter key also sends)
- "Clear Chat" button top right
- Typing indicator (animated dots) while waiting for response

Before each message is sent, the frontend:
1. Queries Supabase for user's documents list (name + category)
2. Queries Supabase for user's achievements list (title + role + impact)
3. Formats both into a vaultContext string
4. Sends to the Edge Function: { messages: conversationHistory, vaultContext: vaultContext }

Show this welcome message on load:
"Hi Sloan! I'm your Coach. I know your full profile, GPA, courses, activities, and everything in your Document Vault. Ask me anything — I can fill out application forms, help with essays, explain financial aid, quiz you on forensic psychology, or tell you what documents you still need. What do you need today?"

--- COACH TAB 2: FORM FILLER ---

Layout:
- Large textarea at top: placeholder "Paste any college application form, FAFSA section, or scholarship question here..."
- "Analyze Form" button (gold, full width)
- Results section below showing formatted output

Output format for each detected field:
[FIELD NAME]
Answer: [generated answer using Sloan's real data]
Character count: XX / limit XX
[individual Copy button]

Below all fields: "Copy All Answers" button that copies entire output to clipboard.

Warning banner above results: "Review all answers carefully before pasting. Verify school-specific requirements and dates."

Loading state: show animated progress bar with text "Coach is reading your form and building your answers..."

- Draft text (textarea, optional): "Paste your draft here for feedback"

Two buttons:
- "Get Outline" — Coach returns a structured outline using Sloan's real background (Patient Enrichment Program, forensic psych goal, Mu Alpha Theta, Link Crew, etc.)
- "Review My Draft" — Coach returns specific, actionable feedback on the pasted draft

All responses reference her actual activities and goals — the Edge Function system prompt ensures this.
